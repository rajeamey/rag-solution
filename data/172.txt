 Due to the current situation and the great challenge for those involved, Telekom is switching phone calls and text messages from Germany to Turkey and Syria via Telekom's mobile and fixed network free of charge for all Telekom and congstar customers retroactively from February 6, 2023 (00:00 o´clock) until February 15, 2023 (24:00 o´clock). Furthermore, the Group will enable Telekom and congstar customers in Turkey and Syria to roam free of charge for data, text messages and voice services until February 15, 2023. Relatives of those affected by the earthquake disaster can thus stay in touch more easily. Helpers on the ground are also supported in this way. In addition, the Group is donating one million euros to "Aktion Deutschland Hilft." "The images and reports currently reaching us from Turkey and Syria are deeply distressing and saddening. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. And we hope that those buried under rubble will be rescued," wrote Telekom CEO Tim Höttges on the social network LinkedIn. "However, we are responding to the helplessness of so many of those affected not only with sympathy, but with concrete help." Solidarity is great, he said. Many Telekom colleagues themselves have relatives in Turkey or Syria.
