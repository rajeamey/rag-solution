## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the workflow for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, and outlines potential improvements.

## Workflow Explanation

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Data Folder**: Place all text files in the `data` directory.
- **Loading Data**: The `IndexingService` class loads the data from the `data` folder, reads each text file, and stores the content in a list.

### 2. Embedding Generation

- **EmbeddingService**: Generates and stores embeddings for each document using the OpenAI API.
  - `generate_embedding_in_bulk` method processes the entire dataset.
  - `generate_embedding` method handles individual text embeddings.
  - `_initialize_db` method creates SQLiteDB to store embeddings.
  - `_store_embedding_in_db` method inserts individual text embeddings in database.
  - `_fetch_embedding_from_db` method retrieves individual text embeddings from database.

### 3. Indexing and Retrieval

- **IndexingService**: Creates a FAISS index from the generated embeddings.
  - The `generate_index` method initializes and populates the FAISS index with embeddings.
- **Document Retrieval**: The `retrive_docs` method in `IndexingService` retrieves relevant documents based on the question embedding.
  - FAISS searches the index for the nearest embeddings to the query.

### 4. Response Generation

- **RAGSolution**: Combines the retrieved documents into a context for the GPT-3.5 model to generate a response.
  - The `generate_response` method constructs a prompt with the retrieved context and the original question.
  - The OpenAI API is used to generate a response based on this prompt.

### 5. Streamlit Integration

- **Interactive Interface**: The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting questions and viewing responses.
  - The RAGSolution object is initialized and stored in the Streamlit session state.
  - User inputs are processed, and responses are displayed within the Streamlit app.

## Future Directions

### 1. Performance Improvements

- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing of embeddings to improve the efficiency of the embedding generation phase.
- **Async Functionality**: Incorporate asynchronous processing for API calls and other I/O-bound tasks to enhance performance.
- **Index Optimization**: Explore different FAISS index types and parameters to optimize retrieval speed and accuracy.
- **Upgrade to GPT-4**: Integrate the latest version of GPT for potentially better performance and more accurate responses.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the GPT model on a specific dataset related to the domain of the application for improved relevance and accuracy.

### 2. Enhanced Features

- **Contextual Understanding**: Improve context handling to maintain conversational state over multiple queries.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Implement dynamic updates to the Knowledge Graph to keep the information current and relevant.
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Integrate reasoning capabilities to allow the system to make logical inferences based on the Knowledge Graph.
### 3. Framework and Storage Enhancements

- **Replacing Streamlit**: Consider replacing Streamlit with a more robust Python web framework (e.g., Flask or Django) to handle complex web applications and deployments.
- **Persistent Vector Database**: Use a persistent vector database for embedding storage instead of relational database. This will reduce computational overhead and improve system efficiency.
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to track the flow of data and identify where issues occur.
- **API Response Handling**: Add error handling for API calls to manage network issues, API rate limits, and other potential failures gracefully.
